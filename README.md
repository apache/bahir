# Apache Bahir

Apache Bahir provides extensions to distributed analytics platforms such as Apache Spark & Apache Flink.

<http://bahir.apache.org/>

## Apache Bahir origins

The Initial Bahir source code (see issue [BAHIR-1](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BAHIR-1)) containing the source for the Apache Spark streaming connectors for akka, mqtt, twitter, zeromq
extracted from [Apache Spark revision 8301fad](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/8301fadd8d269da11e72870b7a889596e3337839)
(before the [deletion of the streaming connectors akka, mqtt, twitter, zeromq](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13843)).

## Source code structure

Source code folder structure:
```
- streaming-akka
  - examples/src/main/...
  - src/main/...
- streaming-mqtt
  - examples
  - src
  - python
- ...
```

## Building Bahir

Bahir is built using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).
To build Bahir and its example programs, run:

    mvn -DskipTests clean install

## Running tests

Testing first requires [building Bahir](#building-bahir). Once Bahir is built, tests
can be run using:

    mvn test

## Example programs

Each extension currently available in Apache Bahir has an example application located under the "examples" folder.


## Documentation

Currently, each submodule has its own README.md, with information on example usages and API.

* [SQL Cloudant](https://github.com/apache/bahir/blob/master/sql-cloudant/README.md)
* [SQL Streaming Akka](https://github.com/apache/bahir/blob/master/sql-streaming-akka/README.md)
* [SQL Streaming JDBC](https://github.com/apache/bahir/blob/master/sql-streaming-jdbc/README.md)
* [SQL Streaming MQTT](https://github.com/apache/bahir/blob/master/sql-streaming-mqtt/README.md)
* [Streaming Akka](https://github.com/apache/bahir/blob/master/streaming-akka/README.md)
* [Streaming MQTT](https://github.com/apache/bahir/blob/master/streaming-mqtt/README.md)
* [Streaming PubNub](https://github.com/apache/bahir/blob/master/streaming-pubnub/README.md)
* [Streaming Google Pub/Sub](https://github.com/apache/bahir/blob/master/streaming-pubsub/README.md)
* [Streaming Twitter](https://github.com/apache/bahir/blob/master/streaming-twitter/README.md)
* [Streaming ZeroMQ](https://github.com/apache/bahir/blob/master/streaming-zeromq/README.md)

Furthermore, to generate scaladocs for each module:

`$ mvn package`

Scaladocs is generated in, `MODULE_NAME/target/site/scaladocs/index.html`.  __ Where `MODULE_NAME` is one of, `sql-streaming-mqtt`, `streaming-akka`, `streaming-mqtt`, `streaming-zeromq`, `streaming-twitter`. __

## A note about Apache Spark integration

Currently, each module in Bahir is available through spark packages. Please follow linking sub section in module specific [README.md](#documentation) for more details.
